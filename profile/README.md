## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Welcome to the **Not-So-Awesome** project

Ugh, you're here? Well, fine, since you've wandered into our realm of relentless griping, we might as well give you the grand tour. Brace yourself for a rollercoaster of complaints, cynicism, and snark because here at the NotSoAwesome Project, we find joy in complaining about life's little imperfections.

We embrace the not-so-awesome aspects of life and technology with a touch of humor. We're a politically left-leaning group that believes in the power of free and open-source software, tempered with a healthy dose of moderation. Our one and only rule: **Don't be a ####head.**


## What's This Project About?

Do you wake up every morning thinking, "What fresh annoyance will today bring?" You're not alone! The NotSoAwesome Project is the place where negativity meets creativity. We've meticulously curated a collection of gripes, so you don't have to waste time finding new things to complain about.

## Our Mission
We focus on the not-so-awesome things in life and tech, offering a platform for people to vent, rant, and share their humorous complaints. We aim to reach a wide audience, build a vibrant community, and provide an opinionated starting point for world-views, because, as we say, if you're too lazy to develop your own views...

## Project Goals
Our primary goal is to create a space where people can express their grievances, find humor in the mundane, and engage in discussions without the fear of judgment. We also aim to provide an opportunity for contributors to gain experience using GitHub.

## Contribution Guidelines
We welcome contributors from all walks of life, as long as they adhere to our "Don't be a dickhead" rule. Feel free to join us in embracing the not-so-awesome side of life and tech!
